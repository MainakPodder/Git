笨Git Branches
    - Ex : 1)In main branch c1->c2->c3(Prod), 
           2)After c3-> You write code for a new feature (Incomplete), 
           3)Now In production some bugs has come
           4)沐ｴUndo all changes and fix the code (Wrong strategy)
           5)沺｢We should have created a branch
    - Master/Main brunch is the default branch
    - HEAD like a pointer which points the current branch
    - Usecase : 1)I have joined a start up company ans assigned for 2 features (Independent code)
                2)After main branch, create branch1 for feature1
                3)After main branch, create branch2 for feature2
    - 箝身it branch -> List me all the branch and * -> current branch
    - 箝身it branch <new_branch_name> -> Create a new branch
    - 箝身it checkout <branch_name> -> Go and checkout the new branch
    - 箝身it checkout -b <new_branch_name> -> Create + Checkout
    - 箝身it branch -m <rename_branch_name> -> Rename the current branch name
    - The branch you are currently checkedout cannot be deleted

笨Git Stash
    - Ex : 1)Some code which is incomplete so that cant commit
           2)Some code is on prod so go to the main branch 
           3)沐ｴHave to undo all the changes and go back to the main branch
           4)沺｢We can temporarily save the code and go back
    - Create a new brach -> ls -> change file1.txt -> git status -> 箝蝕 dont want to commit, want to save the code -> git add. -> git stash
        - git status -> Code will be saved, so nothing to commit 
        - 箝心tash is like commit but not actually commit, when we dont want to commit but also want to save
    - change file2.txt -> git add . -> git commit -m "change file2.txt" -> 箝芯at file1.txt (Linux Command, Get file1.txt content) -> None
    - 箝身it stash apply -> Bring back the saved code -> file1.txt modified
笨Git Merge 
    - What, Why
    - 箝身it marge <branch_name>
    - https://youtu.be/e0rl2PetMIY?si=ylRZ7CPiOj578JRp&t=4965
笨Merge Conflict
    - What is Merge Conflict?
    - Merge Conflict Example
    - How to resolve the Merge Conflict?
    - "Autometic Merge failed;"
    - Whenever we have Merge Conflict we have to manually address it
    - What are "<<",">>","=="
    - Current brach always above the "==" sign

笨Git Remote 
    - 
笨Git Clone 
    - What is git clone?
    - 箝身it clone <https://...>
    - 箝人s
    - 箝身it remote -v 
        - Ex : origin https://... (fetch)
        - It is saying "I am connected to remote repository"
        - And the connection name is origin
    - When we clone a repository then what it will automatically come up with ?
        - 1) Entire codebase 
        - 2) Git initialized  
        - 3) Commit history
    #Command
    - git clone <https://...>
    - ls 
笨Git Fork 
    - Clone -> Creates a local copy of the remote repository
            -> Contribute directly to the original repository (If you hav e permission)
    - Fork -> Creates a copy under your own accout(GitHub)
           -> Contribute via pull requests to the original repository
    - How to Fork?
        - Go to the original repository -> Fork button -> Create fork
    箝仁kdir mainak - Used to create folder
    箝腎ype nul > filename.txt - Used to create file
    箝刃otepad .\file1.txt - Open in notepad 
    箝身it remote -v -> used to list the remote repositorie currently configured in your local repository
    箝迅im <file-name> 
        - a -> Insert Mode 
        - Add changes
        - esc -> :x -> enter
    - How to request to accept our changes?
        - First push the changes (local repository)
        - Send Pull Request (PR) -> It means showing the code to the owner, and after review the code owner will reject/comment/accept the code
    - How to raise PR?
        - Pull requests button -> New pull request buttong -> 2 sections (current branch to target branch) -> 箝燭alled PR -> Create pull request button -> 箝心ee Marge conflict -> If Able to marge -> Add comment -> Create pull request button -> #...
    - What if Marge Conflict is there?
笨Git Rebase
    - Pic -> https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase
    - It is used to integrating changes from one branch onto another
    - Give a senario : (1st Branch - Local, 2nd Branch - Remote)
        - Create a repository in GitHub -> Create 4 files -> Commit Push (Both are in same state) -> In local create file6.txt -> Add+Commit (Local is ahead) -> In Remote manually create file8.txt -> Add+Commit+Push -> 箝身it fetch origin (To check latest changes in remote) -> No file8.txt as in commit -> 箝身it rebase origin/main -> file8 will be there -> git log (Commit will be added)
    #Command
    - git fetch origin
    - git rebase origin/main
笨Rebase Conflicts (1st Branch - Remote, 2nd Branch - Local)
    - Create a repository in GitHub -> Create 4 files -> Commit+Push (Both are in same state) -> In remote change file4 manually -> Add+Commite+Push -> Change file4 locally -> Commit+Push -> 箝身it fetch origin -> 箝身it rebase origin/main -> 沐ｴMarge Conflict -> Go to file4 -> Delete changes -> 箝身it rebase --continue -> git status (沺｢No Marge Conflict)
    #Command
    - git fetch origin
    - git rebase origin/main
    - git rebase --continue
